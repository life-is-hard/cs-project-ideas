# Twitter-Mini Part 2 Functionality Checklist

## Phase 1: Enhancements to Core Features
- [ ] **Likes for Posts:**
  - Implement a system to track likes on posts.
  - Create API endpoints for liking/unliking a post, ensuring dynamic update of likes count.

- [ ] **Basic User Profile Settings:**
  - Allow users to update their profile information (e.g., username, bio, email) through a dedicated API endpoint.
  - Implement functionality for profile picture uploads, considering image storage and retrieval strategies.

## Phase 2: Introduction to Advanced Search
- [ ] **Setup Advanced Search System:**
  - Integrate an advanced search system, like Elasticsearch, with your application (optional, based on your tech stack).
  - Understand concepts such as indices, documents, and mappings relevant to your chosen search system.

- [ ] **Indexing Posts for Search:**
  - Design and create an index for posts, ensuring to define mappings for efficient searching.
  - Implement logic to index new posts, update existing ones, and delete as necessary.

- [ ] **Search Functionality:**
  - Develop an API endpoint for keyword search in posts, utilizing full-text search capabilities of your chosen search system.
  - Integrate search functionality into the UI if a frontend is being developed.

### Tips for Advanced Search:
- Use analyzers to improve search results based on the application's needs.
- Experiment with various query types to achieve desired search precision and recall.
- Monitor performance and adjust indices/mappings accordingly.

## Phase 3: Stress Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
- [ ] **Stress Testing:**
  - Explore and use stress testing tools suitable for your application to simulate high traffic.
  - Implement test scripts for various scenarios (user login, posting, searching) and analyze performance metrics.

- [ ] **Analysis and Optimization:**
  - Identify and address bottlenecks found during stress testing (e.g., slow database queries, inefficient API endpoints).
  - Optimize performance through caching, query refinement, or server configuration adjustments.

- [ ] **Deployment Strategies:**
  - Use infrastructure as code tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to define and manage cloud infrastructure.
  - Automate deployment processes, potentially using configuration management tools.

### Deployment Tips:
- Automate as much as possible to make deployment and scaling efficient.
- Secure your setup using best practices for managing access to cloud resources.
- Monitor application performance and utilize auto-scaling to adjust resources based on demand.

## Additional Notes:
- Regularly commit changes to version control to document the project's evolution and facilitate collaboration.
- **Continuous Learning and Documentation Exploration:**
  - **Official Documentation:** Always start with the official documentation of the programming languages, frameworks, and tools you are using. This is the most reliable source of information.
  - **Technical Blogs and Articles:** Websites like Medium, Dev.to, and personal blogs of developers often have in-depth articles and tutorials.
  - **Video Tutorials:** Platforms like YouTube and Coursera offer tutorials ranging from beginner to advanced levels.

- **Engagement with Community Platforms:**
  - **Stack Overflow:** A vital resource for getting answers to coding questions. Make sure to search for your question before posting a new one.
  - **GitHub:** Explore projects, follow development trends, and participate in discussions on issues or contribute to open-source projects.
  - **Reddit:** Subreddits like r/learnprogramming, r/webdev, and r/programming are great for advice, sharing projects, and networking with other developers.
  - **Discord and Slack:** Many technology-specific communities have Discord or Slack channels where you can chat with other developers, get help, and share knowledge.
