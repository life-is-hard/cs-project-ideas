# Calorie Co App Development Project

## Overview
This project is designed for students embarking on a journey to learn full-stack development with Django and Python. By developing a calorie tracking application, students will gain hands-on experience with essential web development concepts, including Django project setup, user authentication, database modeling, REST API development, frontend design, testing, and deployment.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of Python and Django for web development.
- Learn to implement user authentication and manage a database using Django ORM.
- Develop RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework.
- Create a simple yet functional frontend.
- Practice comprehensive testing strategies for both backend and frontend.
- Deploy the application to cloud services like Heroku and AWS.

- Django project and app architecture.
- Creating and manipulating database models with Django.
- Securing web applications with user authentication.
- Building and consuming RESTful APIs.
- Basic frontend development integrated with Django.
- Writing and running tests to ensure code quality.
- Deploying web applications to cloud platforms.
- Best practices in software development, including version control and code documentation.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Django project structure, facilitating development, testing, and deployment phases. It includes:

- Django project and app directories for core functionality.
- Templates and static directories for frontend components.
- A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization and easy deployment.
